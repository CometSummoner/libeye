github suggesting I name this "fuzzy-guacamole" made me cringe my liver out of my body.

this zscript library for gzdoom on the atari 2600 does projections and de-projections, meaning you can do "I point at the screen and something appears in the 3D world" or "I want to put a 2D text message over that actor living in the 3D world". sounds gucci, right? maybe even prada.

# how do i use this
copy the examples and modify them cuz there isn't a singular stone left unturned lel

# licence
ask me to put an official licence on this and I'll roast your fukken pets in a waffle iron and feed them to your grandparents.
